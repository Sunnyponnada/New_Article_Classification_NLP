# New_Article_Classification_NLP
project aims to develop a machine learning model that can classify news articles into predefined categories, such as sports, politics, and technology, based on their content.

### Overview
 In today’s digital world, news articles are constantly being generated and shared across
 different platforms. For news organizations, social media platforms, and aggregators,
 classifying articles into specific categories such as sports, politics, and technology can help
 improve content management and recommendation systems. This project aims to develop a
 machine learning model that can classify news articles into predefined categories, such as
 sports, politics, and technology, based on their content.
 
 By automating this process, organizations can efficiently categorize large volumes of news
 articles, making it easier for readers to access relevant information based on their interests.

 ### Problem Statement
 The primary objective of this project is to build a classification model that can automatically
 categorize news articles into different predefined categories. The model will be trained using
 a labeled dataset of news articles and will output the most likely category (e.g., sports,
 politics, or technology) for any given arti
 cle.
 The goal is *o:
 ● Develop a robust classifier capable of handling articles from multiple categ
   or*es.
 ● Preprocess the text data, extract meaningful features, and train models to classify the
 a
rt*cles.
 ● Evaluate the model performance and provide actionable insights on how well it
 classifies articles.
